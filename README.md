Suppose a compilation of thousands of computer science instructors' names is stored in a grid. Count the number of people whose last name is Smith.  Write a method that counts the number of people whose last name is a certain common surname. The method has two parameters: a 2D array of String objects and a target string. The method should return an integer that represents the number of strings in the 2D array that contains the target string.
